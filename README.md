# Twitter-Sentiment-Classifier
A twitter sentiment classifier based on Support Vector Machines algorithm

## Overview

Sentiment analysis is a field of study which identifies the opinion of people expressed in a text using natural language processing tools. Social media such as Twitter provides a constant source of textual data, many with an opinion, which can be analyzed using Sentiment Analysis tools.

The code is written in Python and uses scikit-learn library . We use Support Vector Machine (SVM) with Linear kernel.
## Classes of Sentiment

Two classes: Negative(0) and Positive(1).

## Training data

The following training data is publicly available and is collectively used for training the classifier:

#### Stanford Sentiment140
http://cs.stanford.edu/people/alecmgo/trainingandtestdata.zip Size: 1,600,000 tweets

#### Polarity Dataset v2.0
http://www.cs.cornell.edu/people/pabo/movie-review-data/ Size: 1000 positive and 1000 negative processed movie reviews

#### Univeristy of Michigan
https://inclass.kaggle.com/c/si650winter11 Size: 7086 sentences from social media (not necessarily twitter)

## Preprocessing the tweet

We have applied a set of pre-processing steps to make tweets suitable for SVM algorithm and improve performance. The following pre-processing has been done on the tweets:

i. Lower Case - Convert the tweets to lower case

ii. URLs - Convert www.* or https?://* to 'URL'

iii. @username - Convert username to '__HANDLE'

iv. #hashtag - Hash tags can give us some useful information, so we replace them with the exact same word without the hash. E.g. #Apple replaced with 'Apple'

v. Trimming the tweet

vi. Repeating words: People often use repeating characters while using colloquial language, such as "Iâ€™m exciteddddd". We replace characters repeating more than twice with just two characters, so that the result for above would be "I'm excitedd"

vii. Emoticons: Use of emoticons is prevalent in tweets. We identify a set of emoticons and replace them with the reprentative sentiment i.e. '__positive__' or '__negative__'. E.g. ':)' is replaced by '__positive__'. Further, if emoticon(s) are found in the tweet, then the SVM classifier is not called and the tweet is classified as positive or negative simply based on the emoticon.



## Required libraries

To use the classifier, you must have the following libraries installed:

i. scikit-learn version is 0.17.1. (http://scikit-learn.org/stable/install.html)

ii. NLTK version 3.2.1 (https://pypi.python.org/pypi/nltk)

iii. numpy (http://www.numpy.org/)

iv. scipy (https://www.scipy.org/)


## Output

The output of the sentiment analyzer is either 0 (Negative) or 1 (Positive).
